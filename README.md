# Work-Day-Scheduler

The workday scheduler enables users to create and update their diaries to reflect. I used momentJS to work with times and dates and jquery to display the contents of values. The app changes dynamically based on the hour of the day, to better visualise where you are within your diary and what upcoming events you have. Grey rows are for past events, Red for present and Green for future events.
